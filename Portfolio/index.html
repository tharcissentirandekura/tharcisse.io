                <h5>Collatz Conjecture</h5><br><br>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on visualizing the behavior of the Collatz conjecture sequence within a specific range. 
                    Leveraging Python's capabilities, I utilized the matplotlib library to create compelling visual representations.
                    The project aimed to provide deeper insights into the patterns and characteristics of the sequence. 
                    By employing matplotlib's powerful plotting functionalities, I generated visually appealing line 2D
                    plots and scatter plots to showcase the sequence's progression. Customization options were expertly 
                    utilized to refine the visuals, including color schemes, line styles, labels, titles, and annotations
                    and checking if the sequence meets the benford's law( the distribution of leading digits). The project 
                    helped me enhance my knowldge in Python programming, data visualization, and mathematical exploration.
                    It underscored the significance of visual communication in comprehending complex mathematical concepts.
                     I am passionate about further exploring data visualization and its applications in mathematics.
